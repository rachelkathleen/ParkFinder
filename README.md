TO DO:
 -find way to associate notes with user who is creating it and park it was created about
 -make it so only a user who created a note can edit or delete it (or edit/delete themself!)

 -user_view page (for viewing/editing their own page)
 -'show' page for users and parks
    users
      -username
      -bucket list/been list of parks (can this be in the form of chips?

      -notes - chips? cards?
      -maybe use collapsible?
